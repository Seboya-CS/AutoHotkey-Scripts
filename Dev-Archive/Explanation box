;		In the next three lines, the script is being directed to read from the cells in the Excel		||
;		spreadsheet. In the first line, `row := A_Index` is not necessary, unlike the preceding 	||
;		`col := A_Index`. `A_Index` can only refer to the index value of a single loop, so for 		||
;		nested loops it refers to the Index value of the currently active loop. I'm storing its 		||
;		value into `row` simply for readability. In the second line, `ws.Cells` specifies what 		||
;		type of object is being referenced, in this case, the object is a cell, which is a 					||
;		"range" object in Microsoft's object model. `(row + startRow - 1, col + startCol -1)` 		||
;		is an expression used to specify which cell in the spreadsheet is being referenced. 		||
;		The format is (row, column). `row + startRow - 1` and `col + startCol - 1` are used to 	||
;		allow for flexibility. Even though we know the starting row and column of the Excel 	||
;		spreadsheet ahead of time, constructing the expression this way allows this script 		||
;		to be reusable for other purposes too.																							||
